# Huffman encoding

I visited CSCI 151 (Data structures) at Oberlin, and the lecture
was on Huffman encoding. The professor said somthing about an
implementation assignment, and while I couldn't find the specifics
online, I decided to try my hand at something like what I *assume*
the assignment was.

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
